`npm i material-ui-day-time-table`

## Usage

This component is pretty flexible.
It allows you to style your tables how you wish, while also trying to
remain flexible with the format of your data.
To accomplish this, there are a number of trivial functions
which you must supply for how to access the data.

    <DayTimeTable
      caption="This is the table caption"
      cellKey={key}
      calcCellHeight={calcHeight}
      showHeader={displayHeader}
      showCell={displayCell}
      showTime={showTime}
      isActive={isActive}
      toolTip="Table has tooltip"
      max={max}
      min={min}
      data={basic}
      rowNum={(max-min)/interval}
      valueKey="values"
    />

See
[storybook](https://ezralalonde.github.io/material-ui-day-time-table)
for demos, and [storybook source](stories/) for reference.
It's quite simple.
There are examples using [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) for nice times.

The source is the definitive reference.
